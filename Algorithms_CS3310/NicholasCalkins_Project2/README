This is the readme file that describes how to run the code

#1 Fractional Knapsack
1) Input desired information into input.txt
2) Run the program, either by clicking on it or doing 
   $./fractional_knapsack.py 
   from commandline
3) Input desired capacity of knapsack and push enter

#2 0/1 Knapsack
1) Input desired information into input.txt
2) Run the program, either by clicking on it or doing
   $./zero_one_knapsack.py
   from commandline
3) Input desired capacity of knapsack and push enter

***NOTE ON input.txt***
IT IS FORMATTED AS FOLLOWS:

[item profit] [item weight]

So if: 
Item 1 has a profit of 3 and a weight of 2,
Item 2 has a profit of 4 and a weight of 1,
Item 3 has a profit of 8 and a weight of 4,
Item 4 has a profit of 5 and a weight of 3...

Then the contents of input.txt will read as follows:

3 2
4 1
8 4
5 3

As you can see, the item number itself correlates to the line it is in the file
